The Brick Pub & Grill,"Came here on a Sunday night with a few friends. It's was around 8pm.
Place was pretty slow with a couple other patrons. Server was welcoming and pretty cool. We had a table by the window. There was a lot of space.
I had a cocktail called Rob Roy. It was average.
Appetizer was crab cakes. It was surprisingly a lot. Came with 2 patties the size of a bk whopper.
Entree was was seared ahi tuna. It was decent. Tuna tasted fresh. Visually, it looked pretty light. But it got me pretty full. Maybe because the crab cakes were so huge. Overall, I can't give too many points for vibes, since it was a Sunday night. Flavors for pretty average, but quality of ingredients keep it above average. I'd say if you're looking for a chill place to have a conversation, this is a good place. If you're a flavor hunter, it's pretty average.",Henry L.
The Brick Pub & Grill,"Food was good, beers were cold service was a bit slow but it all worked out. Good atmosphere, friendly staff, fair food portions. Good place to chill.",Mike S.

The Brick Pub & Grill,The Brick recently changed their menu again. I miss the Cajun chicken sandwich. I only eat white meat and was glad to have this on the menu. The have since removed it. I asked the server if I could have the chicken sandwich from the old menu and he said yes. WHoooHOOOO. Unfortunately when it came out it is not the same sandwich. It is sliced chicken on a bun. This does not make a good sandwich. The pieces kept falling out of the bread. It was a horrible way to eat. The original was the reason I came to the brick repeatedly. Since that sandwich is gone I don't find anything comparable on the menu. Guess I will have to find another Cajun chicken somewhere else.,Leslie W.
The Brick Pub & Grill,"Our second visit to the Brick Pub. First visit a few months back was not bad.
It took at least 15 minutes for the waiter to come to our table. We ordered drinks and dinner. It took around another 10 minutes for the waiter to bring the drinks over. She was doubling as a bartender too. It took around 40 more minutes to get our food...that's almost an hour since we got there. Not acceptable. Fish from fish and chips was over fried and hard. My wife's flank steak order was sirloin tip according to her, and it was pink on the inside though she ordered it medium well.
All in all, we were pretty disappointed...",Stephen G.

From the outside it looks a little sketchy, but this was a VERY good restaurant! A must try!!

Thanks "" the brick""",Koren C.
The Brick Pub & Grill,"This place was SO good. The owner is really cool and the music is always fun.
With that said...
I have now had three bad meals in a row and I am ready to stop trying. That is big bucks I will never get back. How do you screw up a BLT? The bacon was so overcooked that it was more like burnt bacon dust than meat. The ""Philly cheese steak"" was not good and didn't even come with the advertised aioli sauce. My fries sucked and were cold. How on Earth can you make a bad cheese steak? I don't even remember what they screwed up before that but I still remember the dissapointment coupled with a 70 dollar check.
I have had everything on the menu in the past and it ALL used to be good.
Now, I am afraid to order anything.
I sure hope they fix it back to the way it was. There is nothing like this place in the highlands.",Senor C.
The Brick Pub & Grill,"Just wanted to thank the blonde haired girl and bearded guy working tonight for showing racism. We walked in approx 30 mins ago and sat down at the table next to the bar. No acknowledgement even though both of them looked straight at us. Blonde girl started cleaning one of the machines and the bearded guy just kept talking to his friends. We sat the table for 15 mins and neither of them brought a menu or said Hi to us. After I began staring at the girl wondering why we were being ignored, a white couple came in and sat at the bar. Within 30 seconds he had poured them waters and took their order. He made their drinks and we had yet to be greeted or brought a drink menu. Every person in the bar was white including the couple that came in. Coincidence??? Thank you for ruining our evening and reaffirming that asian people are not welcome at the pub.",Rich L.
The Brick Pub & Grill,"We found this gem on Yelp, and another fantastic find it was. It has local beer on tap that my husband really liked and I had a ""Fru-Fru"" drink the Lavender Mule which was amazing. As if the great drinks weren't enough the food was just as amazing. Ordered the Pastrami Melt and it was some of the best tasting pastrami I have had.
The waitress was very informative and helpful, she knew her products and had answers to all our our questions.
This place is quite a find and it is worth the visit.",Andrea I.

Mean Sandwich,"Mean Sandwich is a high quality sandwich place in the south end of Seattle's Ballard. It serves a limited range of well-produced sandwiches.
The restaurant is in an easy location to reach near the bridge. Parking nearby is limited and we were lucky to find a space in relatively short walking distance. We had come for a late lunch so it wasn't too busy.
Inside there is a very limited set of seating. This is a place that probably works best for takeout, since I wouldn't have felt really confident we could sit down, and don't want to let my food get cold. Service was counter-style, and friendly.
The menu is very limited. I knew this going in, but when faced with the actual choices, there are really only two that appeal to me much and really only one I definitely want.
There is a very appealing sounding side (fried potato lumps called skins and ins). This is exactly the sort of thing I typically love, but it was a bit overcooked and oversalted and I liked it but didn't love it, which was the big disappointment of the visit. I had expected this to be the high point.
When the sandwich arrived, it was great quality. I had a Buon Appetito (chicken). The bread is super - which I think is what tends to be most important. Not too sweet or soft. Great bread. The filling was a bit less exciting. It tasted like pretty normal sandwich fare. Not bad in any way, but not amazing. The portions were giant. With the skins, both of us had about twice as much food as we needed for a lunch and should have shared (except that we wanted completely different things).
Overall, this is a pretty good sandwich place. Much better than most of the regular chains or local places. If something from their tiny selection appeals to you, I recommend a visit. I doubt we'll be going very often, because we didn't bond with the choices we made and there isn't much more we want to try.",Martyn L.

Mean Sandwich,"Are you in the mood for a really exceptional sandwich experience? Then I highly recommend Mean Sandwich and do get The Mean and an order of fries. The burger is really good.

Due’ Cucina Italiana,"I called this evening to verify their cacio e pepe is vegetarian, and it is! yay!
I ordered the cacio e pepe and a slice of sourdough bread through uber eats. The flavor of the cacio e pepe is quite different from what I've had before, I think it's the aged cheese that really made the difference. It was delicious though! The pasta was perfectly cooked (& fresh!) and the 'sauce' still had a really good pepper flavor. The sourdough also came with a light drizzle of olive oil and salt which complemented the pasta perfectly.
Only downside was the temperature, but that's a given with delivery. Definitely looking forward to being able to visit once everything is back open, as this was my first time trying their food. I'm for sure going to order some fresh pasta for home in the future too.",Karrissa D.

I ordered the kale pesto campanelle and it was amazing!! I would definitely order this again. It was cooked perfectly - nice and chewy. My partner ordered the eggplant parm and he was a little disappointed with the portion size; it came in a tiny little box. He was jealous of my kale pesto pasta which I hesitantly shared with him. We shared the tiramisu at the end of our meal and it was fantastic, one of the best tiramisu I have had in awhile. Definitely planning on ordering here more while this pandemic is going on.

My favorite dish is the mushroom and truffle oil pasta The first time, i went with another reviewer's suggestion and added pork. I decided I liked it better without pork since pork was flavorful but a little greasy.
Last time I ordered a pasta with another type of ragu and it was also great but needing cheese. Make sure you request extra cheese if you order this pasta.
I would pass on ordering any of the breads.",Cristina G.

Pomodoro,"Yummy, with big portions. Had takeout during the Covid epidemic, and during this time they are offering 20% off to go orders -- even for wine. I can only imagine how it would be even better for a sit down visit and can't wait for the chance to go back during better times.",Sarah M.
Pomodoro,"We ordered takeout yesterday due to the quarantine of the city. The food was absolutely delicious. Some of the best Italian food we have ever had and so welcome during these challenging times. Chef Antolin is the best at his craft.
We will definitely be calling in another order soon. For everyone who wants a truly first class meal please support this restaurant and their staff.
Thank you for making our dinner and evening so enjoyable at home.",Dan T.
Pomodoro,"Why are these restaurants only in Seattle?
It's as if all these great chefs slaved away in the industry for years, and one day woke up and said, you know what? I'm going to buy a small place, house, bottom floor of a building with three chiropractic offices, and just run my own small kitchen where I can float casually between the pan my guests tables, regaling them with stories of my cooking career and adventures, all the while wowing them with absolutely incredible dishes.
What Zouave is for Italian with a hint of southern French flair, Pomodoro is for Italian with a decidedly Spanish/Mediterranean coastline lean.
The chef knocks it out of the park every time we go here, and the service in largely impeccable, but more so when the chef is hanging around your table.
Outside of traveling abroad, we rarely do a full bottle of wine at dinner in the US, as dinners are often so rushed. Not here. And we always take the chefs recommendation on a bottle once we've decided which of his incredible meals we will take on for the evening.
My personal favorites are the Capellini with the fresh dungeness crab (insanely good) and the puttanesca with prawns. And yes, you should absolutely take the chefs recommended additional spice from his special habanero olive oil that you've read about, or if you're lucky and he has it, his secret truffle oil.
We have two places we go every week or two in Seattle, Canon for drinks and dinner, and Pomodoro for the slightly early dinner on weekends, especially rainy ones where you want nothing more than comfort food, smiles and great red wine.",Mike V.

Pomodoro,"I am giving this restaurant five stars despite a couple of unsettling experiences with our waiter. The food is just that good.
My husband took me out to dinner at Pomodoro last night to celebrate my birthday. It is a lovely little restaurant, with creative lighting (red circle lights, tiny twinkling white lights, and warm yellowish-white lights), and crisp white tablecloths.
I had the tomato cream soup, the paella, and I split the dungeness crab linguine with my husband. My husband also had the pork pancetta. My husband is characteristially very unenthusiastic, so when I asked him how his food was and he said ""good"" (he says ""okay"" 95%+ of the time that I ask him this question), I knew that the food was an unusually special experience for him, too!
My food was absolutely outstanding, probably among the top ten meals I've ever eaten. The chef had a lovely long blurb included in the menu about his love for cooking, a few of his famous customers, and his experience as a chef. While I enjoyed reading this blurb, I definitely judged the food on my actual experience of eating it, which was heavenly.
We also ordered a bottle of the Cava Mont Marcal wine. I enthusiastically recommend this wine. It was outstanding.
Our waiter has a very genteel manner, but his memory and attentiveness are unfortunately severely lacking. We arrived fairly late, just after 9pm, and perhaps he'd had a long and busy night before we arrived. He also appeared to be pushing 90 years old.
He smiled a lot and he seemed like he was trying his best, but he basically ignored us for the middle half of our meal. My husband had to literally get up out of his chair three times to go up to him when we needed something. He was just in his own world (also I think partially closing the restaurant, but we just couldn't get his attention for several minutes on end after several tries).
He was respectful and sweet when he did get to us, however, he also brought up four very serious and upsetting topics (communism, genocide, global warming, and immigration), all of which I deeply care about, however, I would prefer very much to focus on lighter, more pleasant conversational topics while eating a celebratory birthday dinner. It was an odd experience - I must say I've actually never had a waiter bring up such topics when dining out.
At the start of our meal, I informed the waiter that I am gluten-free due to a serious medical condition which gluten can aggravate terribly. I was happy to see that there are gluten-free options for many of the dishes, which I requested. He seemed to really listen to that, which is important to me, and I did not flare with my condition after eating my meal.
However, at the end of the night, he brought me out a surprise piece of tiramisu with a flaming birthday candle on it. He had a huge smile on his face and he looked so excited, and I was delighted! However, when he put the piece of tiramisu in front of me I had a scared feeling for a second and asked him, ""Is this gluten-free?"" He said, ""No."" I said, ""I can't eat it then, can you please take it away?"" He said, ""I'm sorry, I didn't know."" I said, ""Yes, you did know, because I told you at the beginning of the meal that I am gluten-free due to a serious medical condition."" He said again, ""I'm sorry, I didn't know."" To be honest, the apology seemed genuine. He seems like a nice person. But it's a little scary that he completely forgot something that could have caused me serious pain.
But then he said, ""well, your husband can eat it then."" I said, ""My husband will not be eating birthday cake in front of me on my birthday that I am not able to eat."" He offered me Spumoni or coffee on the house. I declined.
I feel like he was really trying to make things right, I think he just wasn't getting it. I got upset and asked my husband to pay for our meals and asked my husband to leave a 20% tip to be polite (I usually tip between 23% - 27%). I left the restaurant and waited for my husband in the car while he paid. I feel like the waiter does embody the spirit of service that I look for when I dine out, despite the unsettling errors on his part.
Recommended, but if you are gluten-free maybe double-check more than you usually would. This food is absolutely stunning.",Artemis L.
Pomodoro,"Yes, yes, yes. Great service, cozy little atmosphere. Not pretentious. Everything was perfect.",Jacey H.

Ristorante Machiavelli,"What a nice find, downtown Seattle -
I wish local-to-me Italian restaurants could pull off the kind of affordable home-made Italian that this place does, right in downtown Seattle, no less.
If I was local, I'd be coming here quite often - I don't know how they make Italian this low of price, and this high of quality. I would have expected to pay more. Heck, in my town, homemade Italian of any kind is starting at over $20 a plate.
This place is comparable in price to Old Spaghetti Factory and Olive Garden (but obviously is worlds better).",John W.
Ristorante Machiavelli,"I love the food. Second to none
The customer service is terrible
Been along time customer and the service has plumbed. They used to be warm and welcoming but not anymore
The owner is wonderful and I wish her the best but the the staff is uninviting, rude and cold.
If you go here it's for the food only.",Ken H.
Ristorante Machiavelli,"I've been to Machiavelli 3 or 4 times now but my opinion of it goes down each time. While the food + price is 5 stars, the wait time & experience makes me feel miserable. Here's my most recent (Tuesday night!) experience:
I arrive and meet two of my friends who are sitting on a bench in the entry hall. Our 4th friend is running late so we can't put our name down yet. This entry hall is maybe 4 feet wide with a small bench & people streaming in and out past the small horde of people waiting. Claustrophobic. After 10 minutes or so, some seats open up in the slightly less crowded bar area. We sit and it's bearable but not like we actually get anything to drink since a) no one comes by to take such an order & b) we're here to eat Italian food not drink shitty alcohol. The clincher is that after our 4th arrives, I have to jostle for position with the other prospective diners as we flag down a harried receptionist who exasperatedly writes our names on the wait list. After 20 minutes, we're finally ready to begin waiting for a table.
Many other restaurants in Capitol Hill also have bad wait times but they usually also:
- Take a phone number & call/text when the table is ready.
Or
- Let you put your name down before your whole party is there.",Zachariah H.

Ristorante Machiavelli,A friend referred me here. We we're in Seattle and our hotel was only two blocks away. We decided to come here for valentines. I can't really judge the wait based on going on the busiest holiday in the year. The is a small but really cute restaurant. As soon as you walk in there's a bench you can sit at if you need to wait. There's a good size bar with tables to the right. Up two steps is the hostess. Once you go to what is considered the second floor it's a small restaurant. I almost felt like I was in a home. The bread and oil they gave with the bread was really good. I ordered a Cesar salad that was pretty good too. My husband ordered your typical spaghetti and meat balls. To my surprise it was pretty authentic and very delicious. I ordered pasta with a white sauce and prawns. My dish was just as good if not better. The service was very good and professional. I would definitely be returning.,Isaiah G.

Ristorante Machiavelli,"Honestly, how can you not love this place. It's the perfect place for authentic Italian food and it's so cheap! We've tried so many different dishes here and love each and every one. If I had to make one recommendation, it would be to try the linguine and clams. Don't forget a wine pairing!
Full warning, there's essentially no parking in this area of capitol hill so you should walk or take a ride share. There's almost always a wait, so plan accordingly. The inside is quite small which means it gets loud quickly, but again it's all worth it. We can't stay away",Carol B.

Extensive menu. We had the eggplant and tortellini with creme sauce, both were spot on. There are so many Italian joints in this general area, this is a good choice for the price. Carafe wine was decent.
We will return.",Michael G.
Ristorante Machiavelli,"We had to wait 1hr, but the food was really worth it.
The Caesar salad with white anchovies was EXCELLENT. Probably the best salad I've ever had, thought it may or may not have been caused by the 1hr wait time. Anyway, the white anchovy add on is a must.
For the main course, I got the chicken liver lasagna. It was delicious, but I also like eating organs (fair warning for those who don't like eating organs normally and want to see if they'd like it. You won't because the distinct flavor was definitely still there).",Jenn N.
Ristorante Machiavelli,"I've eaten here 18 years now. Moved away, but every time I come back to Seattle, this is a must. Cozy and delicious. Chicken Piccata

Tavolàta,"A week ago, we were told Tavolata wouldn't do take out. I phoned tonight, 3/13/2020, and sure enough, Tavolàta was happy to have us pick up food. We have been on a social distance quarantine since the Coronavirus pandemic erupted. I guess other people aren't reading the same research I am. People were out and about, in spite of the rain, and in spite of any contagious virus. The bars on 2nd Avenue were full, including the bar at Tavolàta. I felt foolish, locking myself inside all week, but then again, my age is susceptible to complications if I contract the Coronavirus. Foolish, paranoid, overly cautious, vigilant, better safe than sorry; who knows?
The food from Tavolàta was good. Our rigatoni and pappardelle pastas were good. The Arancini balls were a bit bland for my taste. Carpaccio was okay. Bread was well baked. Prices were Seattle high - $100 for this meal. Expensive, but there isn't much choice in the Emerald City. This is not an egalitarian city anymore.",Phil G.

What puts the cherry on top is the fact that the pasta is made from scratch !! How many places can say that ?? Their happy hour brings plates half off and house wines as well. Employees are very friendly and check in on you often to see if you're doing okay. The reason for the 4 star review is because there isn't much seating space around the bar area... which I believe are the only seats available for Happy Hour menu options (could be mistaken).

Bizzarro Italian Cafe,"I am in Seattle to help at UWMC as a Respiratory Therapist. I have been really delighted by my experience here over the last few weeks, which has been made even better with places like this. I ordered a Caesar salad and gnocchi to take with me on my overnight shift. When I stopped to pick up my order (wearing scrubs since I was on my way to work), I was handed my food and my ticket was ripped up. I was really overwhelmed! I have been trying to help local businesses by ordering out as much as possible, but to be recognized for helping during the pandemic is appreciated immensely. The best part? The food was wonderful! Thank you so much, Bizzarro! I will be back and my tip will reflect my gratitude.",E. R.
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,"A hard five stars for this quirky and authentic Italian restaurant! The first and most notable feature is their magnificent decoration! Bikes hang from the ceiling, ""Big eyes"" paintings with a Wes Anderson narrator on a old time stereo greet you in the bathroom, with many other alluring Knick knacks in every corner.
Not only is the ambiance to die for, BUT THE FOOD! Hand rolled pastas with many other on season dishes for a super reasonable price. They have a famous tomato based sauce that is a must taste (My fave thing on their menu is the ""Margarita"" pasta dish)

Bizzarro Italian Cafe,"We're headed back tonight so I guess I should get around to reviewing our last experience!
We arrived around 8 on a Weeknight and I had had a terrible day, it was pouring, we were freezing and tired, and Italian was calling our name.
Welcomed at the front door, they led us back to the ""Best Table in the House"" - a tiny, candlelit table tucked into a little alcove in the back of the restaurant, where the glass table top covers hundreds of little notes left on the back of dinner receipts from others who have sat here.
We always start with Arancini - these are creamy and just the right bit of a bite, crispy and nestled in a little bath of Bizzaro's delicious marinara.
I order the Meatballs, available only on Monday nights. He orders the special - Gnocchi with Italian sausage.
The server is the same woman who has waited on us our last 5 times here - I wish I knew her name so I could give her the recognition she deserves. She's funny, so friendly, and just the right amount of attentive. We love her!
Food arrives - gnocchi is pillowy and rich, slightly chewy, drenched in a delicious, creamy, herb filled cream sauce. The meatballs are tucked into a perfectly cooked pile of pasta - not spaghetti, but a shorter, thicker, rolled tube noodle covered in light and garlicky marinara, and swaddled in a blanket of melted cheese.
We are far enough away from other tables that we
can enjoy the bits of their conversation that we hear, but we are private enough to enjoy our own.
For dessert, we had gelato that came with some pretty cute little friends on top - that I didn't even mind beheading to scoop up a bit of melted gelato.
Bottom line - we didn't need romance but it's impossible not to get swept up in it if you're here with someone you love. We didn't need for anything while we were there because the service is excellent. And we didn't need two boxes for leftovers because the boyfriend ate his whole plate clean.
Please go here. Please keep this place alive. Bizzaros is a gem that should be shined!",Erin M.

After a handful of visits, I think I'm done with Bizzarros cafe. The food quality for the price point just isn't up to snuff. I recently ordered some cacio e peppe - and it was like eating a giant bowl of bland noddles. I would guess that to make that dish a star you need super fresh and spicy pepper along with noodles cooked to perfection. Nope.

Bizzarro Italian Cafe,"So we ordered take out from here this weekend and was a little disappointed. 1) Their ""small salad "" for 10 bucks is nothing more than about three pieces of lettuce and one strip of carrot - definitely NOT worth it. 2) They completely forgot adding the chicken on one of our pastas which was an extra charge 3) They packaged the other pasta horribly and the sauce spilled completely in the bag. What was left was thin and insubstantial- for a 20 dollar pasta dish I expected ALOT more. 4) I will say, their chicken dish was AMAZING. Almost worth overlooking their shortcomings. Almost.

The food itself was fresh and different than what I've had before. We really enjoyed our dinner here!",Tayler H.
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,"This spot is a must for locals and visitors. It is quintessential Seattle in all the right ways.
I love this spot because it is as fun as it is tasty. And it is very fun... and very tasty. So much eye candy and everything on the menu is ridiculously good.
If you haven't been to Bizzarro, then I recommend you go. And if you are planning to go to Bizzarro, then I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the lasagna - you're welcome :) Enjoy",Ray M.
